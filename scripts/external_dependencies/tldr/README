This tool requires building it yourself on the container. There are two ways to do that..

Note* This tool only works on RHEL 8+

First Way:
    - Run the script ./scripts/external_dependencies/tldr/upgrade_tldr.zsh
    - This will handle everything
Second Way:
    - Manually follow the instructions below
    - Note: The script above is just an automated version of the below instructions.
        So in a sense, the below instrucitons are pseudo code and can be used to debug if something goes wrong.

1. Boot into rocky8 container
2. Run the command "sudo su" to log in as the super user
3. Run the command "dnf install -y cargo"
4. Run the command "dnf install -y unzip"
5. Run the command "exit" to get back to the user vagrant
6. Get the tag of the latest release from (https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc/releases/latest)
    then git clone it with the syntax "git clone --branch <tag_name> https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc.git"
6. In the directory with the code run the command "cargo build" to build tldr
7. Copy/Replace the ./target/debug/tldr binary into the wcs-zsh repository in external_dependencies/bin/
8. Delete the cloned git repository
9. Run the command "curl --location --output ./pages.zip "https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-pages.en.zip"" to download the newest tldr pages in zip format
10. Run the command "mkdir tlrc; cd tlrc; unzip ./pages.zip -d ./pages.en/" to unzip those pages into a directory named pages.en inside of tlrc
11. Copy/Replace the ./tlrc/ directory into the wcs-zsh repository in external_dependencies/tldr/
12. Confirm that the updated binary works on all supported OS (Rocky8, Rocky9)
13. Submit tldr version to EFOSS for approval
14. Submit tldr version to security for SSP-39 approval
15. Submit a merge request
