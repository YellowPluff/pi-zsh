# WCS-ZSH offers quite a few user configurable options.
# Every user configurable option has a default assinged that we believe offer the best experience
# out of the box, but we encourage everyone to look at the options they have.
#
# For a list of user configurable options, you can run the following command:
#   list_options
#
# For setting your own value, you can copy/paste the flag here and set the value you want.
# For example, if you wanted to always show command run time even if the command finished
# instantly, you'd copy and paste the following below:
#   # display run time minimum time (in seconds)
#   COMMAND_RUN_TIME_MINIMUM_TIME_TO_DISPLAY=0
